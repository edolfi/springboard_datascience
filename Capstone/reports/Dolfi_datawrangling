Goals for Data Wrangling:

1. Clean parks dataset to ensure there is a joinable ID
2. Clean parks to remove unwanted fields
3. Join the following layers to the parks for amenity info:
	- Count of basketball courts
	- Count of play areas
	- Count of spray features
	- Count of preserves
	- Count of swimming pools
	- Count of trails
4. Join the following to the parks for surrounding populaion info:
	- Total population living within a 10MW
	- Age, race/ethnicity and income demographics tagged to each parks
	
See Jupyter notebook file to view steps to do the above:

Challenges to these steps:
- index was inconsistent across different datasets
- the group by step with park amenity counts took multiple iterations (plus stack overflow to figure out)
- the group by easily cut down unwanted fields, so things stayed pretty clean
- since I did a LEFT join for all merges except the last, I filled all NaN values with "0" assuming 
  that any empty cells did not have those amenities
- I decided on an INNER join for the last merge, so all parks in the study would have 10-minute walk statistics.


Future data wrangling steps once twitter data is in hand:
	- Tag each parks with # of tweets (indicator of park visitation)
