Goals for Data Wrangling:

1. Clean parks dataset to ensure there is a joinable ID
2. Clean parks to remove unwanted fields
3. Join the following layers to the parks for amenity info:
	- Count of basketball courts
	- Count of play areas
	- Count of spray features
	- Count of preserves
	- Count of swimming pools
	- Count of trails
4. Join the following to the parks for surrounding populaion info:
	- Total population living within a 10MW
	- Age, race/ethnicity and income demographics tagged to each parks
	
See Jupyter notebook file to view steps to do the above:

Future data wrangling steps once twitter data is in hand:
	- Tag each parks with # of tweets (indicator of park visitation)
